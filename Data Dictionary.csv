,repository_purpose,(DA) Data Access Repository: This would be a repository that allows users to access data on their site.
,,"(DA) Data Searching Repository: This would be roughly defined as a ?repository of repositories.? Users of the data searching repository would use the repository to search for datasets, but, rather than providing access to the dataset, the repository would provide a link to another repository where the data may be accessed (in other words, a data searching repository does not provide access to a dataset, it informs the user where to find the dataset)."
,,"(PA) Partial Aggregator: Repository with both data access and data searching characteristics. Specifically, refers to repositories where some datasets may be accessed on the repository while others may only be accessed through linkages to a different repository."
